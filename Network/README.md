They are three types of methods to create the Networks.

M1: All nodes are already connected and the edges are picked randomly
M2: All nodes are already connected and the edges are picked according to a distribution ('Poisson', 'Normal', 'Uniform' ...) in this case we need a mean for all interactions and a para for 'Normal' and 'Uniform' interaction
M3: The edges are created with already made networks

You can fix memory and agression (so every individual has the same and it doesn't evolve through generations)
